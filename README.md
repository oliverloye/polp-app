## Setting up the project

This setup assumes you have node.js install on your computer.

After cloning the project 'cd' into the project folder and either open the project in your favorite editor and run the following commands or run the commands directly in terminal/cmd/gitbash:

### `npm install`

### `npm run dataserver`
- keep it running

- in a new terminal window run:
### `npm start`

You are now ready to test the PoLP for this application.

Good luck!
